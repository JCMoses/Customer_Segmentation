This project is an example using the Chinook dataset of an analysis of customer segmentation

The analysis and coding is undertaken in the RMD file, and can also be viewed in html.
As noted in the RMD / html files, only a simple model using XGBoost was undertaken.
Proper modelling would involve many models, tuning, and the creation of ensembles.

The results of the analysis are best viewed in the App.R file
